## Project Overview

This project involves creating a Streamlit web application that integrates a Mapbox map, incorporates the OpenAI API, and features a chatbot agent. The objective is to create an interactive and user-friendly app where users can interact with the chatbot and view locations on a map.

## Checklist of Tasks

- [x] **Skeleton with Mapbox**: Set up the basic Streamlit app framework and integrate the Mapbox API for map functionality.
- [ ] **Incorporate OpenAI API**: Implement the OpenAI API to leverage AI capabilities in the app.
- [ ] **Create an Agent**: Develop a chatbot agent that can interact with users, using the OpenAI API for processing and responding to queries.
- [ ] **Link Everything Up**: Ensure all components of the app (Mapbox, OpenAI API, chatbot) are seamlessly integrated and functioning together.
- [ ] **Rearrange the Layout**: Fine-tune the app's layout for optimal user experience and aesthetics.

## Development Instructions

1. **Skeleton with Mapbox**:
   - Ensure Mapbox API is correctly integrated.
   - Display the map with desired default settings (e.g., focus on a specific region).

2. **Incorporate OpenAI API**:
   - Set up the OpenAI API key and ensure secure storage.
   - Implement API calls to OpenAI within the app for processing user input.

3. **Create an Agent**:
   - Design and develop the chatbot's conversational logic.
   - Integrate the chatbot with the OpenAI API for advanced language processing.

4. **Link Everything Up**:
   - Connect the chatbot responses to relevant actions on the map (if applicable).
   - Ensure data flow between the chatbot and the map is smooth and logical.

5. **Rearrange the Layout**:
   - Organize the UI elements for ease of use.
   - Test the app on different screen sizes and adjust the layout responsively.

## Additional Notes

- Keep the app's dependencies updated.
- Regularly test the app for bugs and performance issues.
- Consider user feedback for future improvements.
